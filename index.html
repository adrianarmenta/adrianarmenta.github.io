      <h1>ESports And Why It's A Growing Industry</h1>
    <p>Over the years gaming was considered just a hobby for many
        but as the industry has grown and developed it's become so much more than that.
        Competitive gaming has become mainstream and is still gaining 
        success with the <strong>TSM being valued at $410 Million.</strong>
        Gaming has become a billion dollar industry where people can actually
        make a living off of gaming. Not only is their opportunity in 
        ESports, but with the growth of <strong>Twitch</strong> and <strong>Youtube</strong>
        it's now possible to make a career off of live streaming video games.
